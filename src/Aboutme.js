              <p>
                Hi There! my full name is Yadira de la Torre Ruiz, I am an
                mexican living in Monterrey, Nuevo le√≥n. <br /> Something about
                me is that I like activities that I can do at home; watching
                series/animes, playing videogames, learning cooking recipes,
                etc.
                <br /> About my working life, I have been doing 3D general
                stuff; animation, rigging and modeling for videogame studios,
                which I find really fun to do, but now I am planning to expand
                my knowledge into the tech world, starting my journeying with
                learning the basics of programming, Front-End and Back-End
                design with SheCodes.
              </p>

          </Row>
        </Container>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
